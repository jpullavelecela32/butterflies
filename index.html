				South Bronx Artist's quest to save the Monarch Butterfly</h1>

			<p class="intro">When Mott Haven artist Blanka Amezcua was growing up in the Mexican state of Michoacan, 
                every fall the sky would fill with Monarch butterflies settling in for the winter after flights of up to 2,500 miles from places as far away as New York and Canada. 
                
			</p>
			<p>
				Her passion for Monarchs has never waned.  
			</p>

            <p>Now she’s using her art to help save the brightly colored butterflies, which have been driven to 
                the brink of extinction through loss of habitat, use of harmful pesticides and global warming.  
                </p>

             <p>
                In late September, Amezcua spent two days in Hunts Point Riverside Park conducting a “Hail to 
                the Super Monarch Butterfly” workshop to teach residents from Hunts Point about this migratory insect that is exclusive to North America.  
                 
             </p>
<p>
    She had visitors young and old using her colorful craft sticks, markers, scissors, to paint and 
create a monarch butterfly of their own. Once they were engaged, she’d take the opportunity to teach about the Monarch – how to differentiate a male from a female, their migratory customs, and the importance of planting milkweed in places they use for stopovers on their long flights south.  Milkweed is where they plant their eggs.

</p>
<p>
    “I created this workshop to make [people] understand the importance of the monarch 
    butterflies,” Amezcua said. “If we don’t have [the butterfly] it [creates] a chain reaction.”
    
</p>
<p>
    Just like bees, the monarchs are important for their ecosystem because they pollinate the 
wildflowers they feed on. The west and east coasts of North America, including New York State,
benefit from them.  

</p>
<p>
    The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <a href="https://www.iucn.org/press-release/202207/migratory-monarch-butterfly-now-endangered-iucn-red-list">reported</a> in July that the numbers of 
    Monarchs had dropped by more than 99% on the West Coast between 1980 and 2021 and by 
    84% on the East Coast between 1996 and 2014.

    As Amezcua was growing up, the arrival of the Monarchs in her region of Mexico often  
    coincided with the celebration of the Day of the Dead, or “Día de los Muertos,” which is Nov. 2.  
    It is a revered annual event because many people believe the Monarchs represent their loved 
    ones who have passed away.
     
</p>
<p>
    “It means [their] souls are coming back,” Amezcua explained.
</p>
<p>
    The migration south typically starts in mid-August.  Sightings of the monarchs are not common 
    in the South Bronx, because of its dense urban environment.  Yet they do show up in places 
    with an abundance of plants and flowers.
     
</p>
<p>
    
“There are some at the community garden,” Amezcua said. “I run in Randall’s Island [and] I see 
them there lately.”


</p>
<p>
    Monarchs overwinter in Mexico and then as a group head back north in the spring.  Their short 
lifespans, which are about four to five weeks, mean their descendants must complete the 
journey.

</p>

<p>
    Josephine Gordon of Hunts Point was passing by Amezcua’s workshop in the park with her two 
    children when they decided to join the fun.     
    
</p>
<p>
    “I don’t know anything about them,” Gordon confessed.  But after learning about the Monarchs, she was she was willing to take steps to reverse the endangered status of the butterfly.
</p>
<p>
    When Amezcua isn’t doing Monarch teach-ins, she creates artworks in a variety of mediums.  
One medium includes “papel picado” or pecked paper, a decorative craft made by cutting 
designs into tissue paper.  Another of her works, RE-KONZTRUKT, illustrates women in cotton 
fabric using embroidery and crochet “in ordinary poses and day to day clothing holding or 
resting on a tool, ready to transform the world.”

</p>
<p>
    Her next monarch workshop will take place at the Sugar Hill Children’s Museum. The date is not
announced yet.
